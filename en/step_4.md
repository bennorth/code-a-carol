## Code the introduction

The introduction is the melody associated with the words

_On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me_

Here is the music, but don't worry if you can't read music as we have labelled each note too. "C4" means the note "C" in octave 4, which is how Sonic Pi refers to notes.
