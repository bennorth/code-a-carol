## Put it all together

Now that you have all of the parts of the song, it's time to put it together. You will be able to recreate all twelve verses of the song using just the functions you have already written and a bit of logic!

Here is a flow chart which shows an algorithm which will generate the entire song:

### Challenge: write the code from the flow chart

Can you use the flow chart to write the song?

**Yellow** boxes represent the functions you have written
**Green** boxes represent loops (e.g. `12.times do`)
**Purple** boxes represent decisions (e.g. `if days >= 5`)
The **and a** box is where you need to add a single note to represent the "and" from _"and a partridge in a pear tree"_. This is because the first partridge doesn't need an "and"!

If you would prefer to follow step by step instructions for how to write the code instead, move on to the next step.
