## Step by step song

+ At the bottom of your code, underneath your functions, remove any calls to the functions you may have left over from when you tested them.

+ Create a variable called `days` and set its value to 1

```ruby
days = 1
```

+ Next, create a loop that runs 12 times, once for each verse of the song.

```ruby
12.times do

end
```

Now let's start building up the song. Instead of calling each function over and over, making a very long program, we can use some logic to decide which parts to play and how many times to repeat each one.

+ We already know that the introduction and the _partridge in a pear tree_ happen in every verse, so add a call to your `intro` and `partridge` functions inside the loop.

```ruby
12.times do
    intro
    partridge
end
```

Now let's think about the other days, starting with the 12th day.

+ Days 12 - 6 have the same melody which is the one inside our `item` function.
+ Day 5 has a special melody - the `five_gold_rings`
+ Days 4 - 2 have the same melody as `item` if we hear them as part of a verse number which is less than 5, but they have the special `four_three_two` melody if they happen after `five_gold_rings`.

+ Add some code between the `intro` and the `partridge` to test whether the number of days is five or above:

```ruby
12.times do
    intro
    if days >= 5

    end
    partridge
end
```

If it is, you need to play the `item` melody the correct number of times. If it is day 12, for example, this will be 7 times (for days 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 and 6). You can work out the correct number of times to repeat by taking the number of days minus 5, because the last 5 days are handled differently.

+ Add some code to work out how many times to play the `item` melody, then repeat it that many times:

```ruby
if days >= 5
    repeat = days - 5
    repeat.times do
      item
    end
end
```

+ Immediately after the code finishes repeating `item`, add the code to play the `five_gold_rings` and the special `four_three_two` melody.

+ Run your code. You will hear the intro and the partridge, but no items. This is because the `days` variable equals 1. Change the value of the variable to a number between 12 and 5 and check that you hear the right melody for the day you selected.

+ Once you are finished testing, change the days variable back to 1.

Now you just need to handle days 4 - 2.

+ Underneath the `four_three_two` line, add an `elsif` to handle these days. The code has already decided that `days` is less than 5 (otherwise this check wouldn't be happening) so you only need to check whether `days` is greater than 1 to be sure to capture days 4 - 2.

```ruby
elsif days > 1

```

+ This time, you want the `item` melody to repeat in the same way as it did for days 12-5. You can calculate how many times you want it to repeat by taking the number of `days` minus one (because we don't need to play it for the partridge day).

```ruby
elsif days > 1
    repeat = days - 1
    repeat.times do
        item
    end
```

+ Finally, locate your cursor after the `partridge` function - this is the end of the verse. Add one to the `days` variable so that we hear the verse for every day.

```ruby
days = days + 1
```

+ Run your code and check that you hear the right song.
